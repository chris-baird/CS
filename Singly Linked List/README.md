## About
A singly linked list is **a type of linked list that is unidirectional**, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.

**Best for:** Fast **Insertions** and **Deletions**

## Methods

 - ### Push
	**`push(value)`** is passed a value and will add a new node to the end of the linked list.
	**returns** the linked list.

 - ### Pop
	**`pop()`** when called removes the node at the end of the linked list.
	**returns** the removed node.
 - ### Shift
	**`shift()`** when called removes the node at the beginning of the linked list.
	**returns** the removed node.
 - ### Unshift
	**`unshift(value)`** when called will add a new node at the beginning of the linked list.
	**returns** the linked list
 - ### Get
 - ### Set
 - ### Insert
 - ### Remove
 - ### Reverse

## Big%20O

 - **Insertion** O(1)
 - **Removal** O(1) if **First item** of list **or** O(n) **otherwise**
 - **Searching** O(n)
 - **Access** O(n)
